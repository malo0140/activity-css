    <p>You are a cast-away in <strong>Rapture</strong>, an underwater Utopia torn apart by civil war. Caught between powerful forces, and hunted down by genetically modified <em>splicers</em> and deadly securtity systems, you have to come to grips with a deadly, mysterious world filled with powerful technology and fascinating characters. No encounter ever plays out the same, and no two gamers will play the game the same.</p>

        <li>Lead him and his comrade to the water and zap them all with 1000 Volts</li>
        <li>Take research photos of him to learn his weaknesses</li>
    </ul>
